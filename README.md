Final Capstone Project - Maria Jose Mejia Calvo
# Project: Cinephile - the ticket to great entertainment

## Project Description
Cinephile is a web application that allows users to discover and watch movies and TV series from all over the world in a very straightforward way. Most movie web applications show lots of content and user might feel overwhelmed, at the point of not wanting to watch anything, or simply turning into other movies websites to explore more appealing options.
Cinephile is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with a simple and clean environment that guides the user to what exactly is looking for.

7. Once the content is displayed, the  movies and TV series are shown in card gallery design.

This is convenient, so the user don't have to go back and start the search from the beginning.
